# Wine-Up
The data was pulled from the UCI Machine Learning Repository - Wine Quality Data Set
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

Both the red and white wine datasets were used.

Project Goals:
* Create a machine learning model that predicts wine quality based on quantitative physiochemical characteristics of each wine

Separate models were created for each: red, white, and combined datasets as training sets.
Each model was then applied to the other set and the results were compared.
The models used were: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
